<h1 id="minimap-design">Minimap Design</h1>

<p>This document presents a basic overview of how the minimap is designed
for the unity project.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>The minimap can support a few different scenarios and
requirements, let&#39;s define those at the start of
this document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Show player&#39;s surroundings.</li>
<li>Allow for easy navigation of virtual space.</li>
<li>Highlight relevant information for a user.</li>
<li>Allow player to focus on minimap to find important information.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>This is a very broad definition of a minimap but there are a few
existing high level minimap designs that could be derived from this.</p>
<p>The simplest minimap may be something that just shows
the room the player is located in relative to
previously explored rooms like in the game
Super Metroid.</p>

<p>A more complex version of this minimap design may be something similar to
Star craft 2&#39;s minimap which shows fog of war, terrain, units, as well
as other important features and has navigation controls.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>From the given requirements and examples above, we can define a set of
features that satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p>There are many designs and layers to the minimap,
but as a basic set of goals, the minimap would
need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Show a high level view of the world.</li>
<li>Show the player their position relative to the world.<ul>
<li>This can have varying levels of detail. For example,
the Metroid map just shows the room the player is in
while the StarCraft map highlights every unit in
the player&#39;s vision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expand to show new areas as the player explores them.</li>
</ol>
<p>These capabilities implemented together should
satisfy all the requirements we defined earlier.</p>
<h2 id="design-overview">Design Overview</h2>
<p>The minimap component itself will be implemented
similar to that of StarCraft and Metroid as a UI element
on the screen. To implement the features described in
the previous section, we will need to combine a
few components and layers together.</p>
<h3 id="view-of-world">View of World</h3>
<p>The minimap itself should just show the world around
the player. To make this the most simple, we can allow
the end user to give the minimap a sprite/image texture
to display as the base of the map.</p>
<p>We can then draw a scaled version of this image as
the minimap on the screen.</p>
<p>We could generate this image from a terrain map
or labeled structure but at the most general level,
we simply need to draw an image on the screen.</p>
<h3 id="relative-position">Relative Position</h3>
<p>Once we have the basic image down, we need to then
show where the player is viewing the map.</p>
<p>The simplest way to do this is to make some sort of
icon/drawing to show the player on the minimap.
Again, the most general form of this would be just to
draw a sprite on top of the minimap to show the player.</p>
<p>Additionally, sometimes a minimap can be too large
so showing a zoomed in version of the minimap to
highlight local features and having the center of
the map move with the player may make it easier to
view and read. This is how the map in metroid
is configured.</p>
<p>However, this moving map feature is a more
specialized feature as not every map needs this
feature. For example, the StarCraft map
provided earlier just draws a square to show
the area the player is viewing.</p>
<h3 id="reveal-new-areas">Reveal New Areas</h3>
<p>The last general feature I would like to add to
the minimap is revealing new areas. With the
StarCraft map as well as the Metroid map, the map
expands and shows new area as the player explores
them.</p>
<p>There are two main ways this could be implemented.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding to the base map image every time a new
 area is explored.</li>
<li>Having a cover over the original map and revealing
 parts of it as it is explored.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since we assumed that the map would be a static image
from an earlier step, revealing parts of the map
would probably be the easiest method for implementing
this.</p>
<p>Lots of image editing programs such as GIMP or PhotoShop
have a concept of layers and masks. To achieve revealing
the map from a cover, we simply would need to draw a
layer over the original map and erase parts of the
cover as the player explores new areas.</p>
<h2 id="other-features">Other Features</h2>
<p>Some additional features that seem to be in common
use among many games include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation via minimap</li>
<li>Fog of war exploration</li>
<li>Expanding to a full screen map</li>
<li>Highlighting objects on the minimap</li>
</ul>
